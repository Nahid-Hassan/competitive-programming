/*
First, it is clear that if the sum of all numbers ai is less than k, then Peter in any case will
not be able to grow a flower to the desired height, and you should output <<-1>>.

Secondly, it is easy to see that if we want to choose a one month of two,
in which we watered the flower, it is better to choose one where the number of ai is more.
Thus, the solution is very simple: let's take months in descending order of numbers ai and in these months water flowers.
As soon as the sum of the accumulated ai becomes greater than or equal to k â€” should stop the process, the answer is found.
